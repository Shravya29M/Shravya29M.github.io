## PROJECTS
# Center Embedded Pixel Positioning
    Employing CEPP (Content Extraction through Post-processing), we
    effectively address the constraints of traditional image steganography.  
    Even post-cropping, the embedded text remains accessible,
    overcoming previous limitations. Moreover, to enhance security
    measures, I encrypted the data before embedding it into the image,
    adding an additional layer of protection.

# Skin Cancer Detection System:
    At the VIT internal hackathon for the Smart India Hackathon, our team
    of six developed a sophisticated skin cancer detection system. By
    inputting an image, our system swiftly classifies it as either malignant
    or benign. We're enthusiastic about its potential to improve early
    diagnosis and treatment of skin cancer.  

# AI and ML course at the National University Of Singapore
    During a week-long program at NUS, I had the privilege to immerse
    myself in an intensive study of AI and ML. Through comprehensive
    sessions and hands-on workshops, I gained invaluable insights into
    cutting-edge technologies shaping the future of these fields.
